## 🚀 **Embarking on a Journey to Master Python!**  

Hey everyone! 👋 I'm starting an exciting **15-Day Python Challenge** where I will be learning and practicing **Python programming** every single day! 🏆 My goal is to **understand the fundamentals, write efficient code, and build small projects** along the way.  

## 📅 **Challenge Plan (15 Days of Python)**  

🔹 **Day 1-3:** Python Basics – Introduction, Data Types, Variables, Operators, and Syntax 📖  
🔹 **Day 4-6:** Control Flow – If-Else, Loops, and Functions 🔄  
🔹 **Day 7-9:** Data Structures – Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, and Sets 📂  
🔹 **Day 10-12:** OOP in Python – Classes, Objects, Inheritance, and Encapsulation 🏛️  
🔹 **Day 13-14:** Modules & File Handling – PIP, Built-in Modules, Reading/Writing Files 📝
