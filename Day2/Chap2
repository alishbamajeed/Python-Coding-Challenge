🌟 **Embarking on My Python Journey!** 🌟

I’ve officially started my Python learning journey, and I’m loving every moment of it! 💻✨ Here's a quick update on what I’ve learned so far on **Day 2**:

🚀 **Day 2 Learnings:**

1. **Variables and Data Types:**  
   Learned how to use variables in Python and explored different data types like `int`, `float`, `str`, `list`, `tuple`, `set`, and `dict`. 💡

2. **Operators:**
   - **Arithmetic Operators (+, -, *, /, %, //, **)**: Performing mathematical operations. ➕➖✖️➗
   - **Assignment Operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=)**: Assigning values to variables. 🔄
   - **Comparison Operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)**: Comparing values. ⚖️
   - **Logical Operators (and, or, not)**: Evaluating logical conditions. 🤔

3. **Identity and Membership Operators:**  
   Understood how to use **Identity (`is`, `is not`)** and **Membership (`in`, `not in`)** operators to compare objects and check for membership in collections. 🔍

4. **Loops:**  
   Learned how to use **`for`** and **`while`** loops in Python, and how to control them with **`break`** and **`continue`** statements. 🔄

5. **Typecasting:**  
   Learned how to convert between different data types using functions like `int()`, `str()`, and `float()` to perform typecasting. 🔄📊

Every day is a new learning experience, and Python is making my coding journey even more exciting! 🎉
